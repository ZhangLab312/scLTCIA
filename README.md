## üìú Abstract

Single-cell type annotation faces critical challenges in real-world scenarios, including catastrophic forgetting, high-dimensional sparsity, and extreme class imbalance. This paper introduces **scLTCIA**, a novel framework that synergizes **distribution-aware generative replay** and **expression-aware knowledge distillation** to enable robust continual learning of novel cell types while preserving knowledge of previously learned types. Through extensive experiments on five scRNA-seq datasets, scLTCIA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both ordered and shuffled incremental annotation tasks, outperforming existing methods by up to **9.47%** in rare-type accuracy.

## üéØ Key Contributions

1. **Distribution-Aware Conditional Diffusion**  
   A novel generative paradigm that reconstructs high-fidelity scRNA-seq data with dynamic sparse masks, preserving biological consistency during incremental replay.
2. **Expression-Aware Multi-View Alignment**  
   A knowledge distillation framework that aligns gene-specific features across scales through attention mechanisms, addressing the high-dimensional sparsity of single-cell data.
3. **Fuzzy Incremental Guidance**  
   A constraint mechanism that suppresses spurious recall of novel cell types in long-tailed distributions, improving annotation robustness.

## üîç Core Methodology

### Problem Formulation

- **Class-Incremental Annotation**: Sequential introduction of disjoint cell type sets `ùí¥_œÑ`
- **Challenges**:  
  - Long-tailed distribution (e.g., CD34+ cells: 0.29% in Zheng68k)  
  - High-dimensional sparsity (16,384 genes √ó extreme zero-inflation)  
  - Catastrophic forgetting (base-type accuracy drops ‚â§3.2% in final sessions)

### Framework Components

1. **Retrospective Generation Module**  
   - Dynamic sparse mask `ùìú_t` guided by expression quantiles  
   - Conditional diffusion with text-encoded cell type embeddings  
2. **Incremental Alignment Module**  
   - Multi-scale attention alignment (`L_attn`)  
   - Semantic consistency constraints (`L_repr`, `L_logit`)  
   - Fuzzy guidance loss for novel-type suppression

## üì¶ Dataset Availability

The curated benchmark datasets used in our study are publicly available on **Zenodo**:

üîó **[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15533627](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15533627)**

This collection includes five widely used human single-cell transcriptomic datasets across diverse tissues and biological conditions:

- **He et al.** (Cell Research, 2021): Human embryonic skeletal development  
- **Madissoon et al.** (Genome Biology, 2020): Stability of lung, spleen, and esophagus  
- **Stewart et al.** (Science, 2019): Immune zonation in human kidney  
- **Vento-Tormo et al.** (Nature, 2018): Early maternal‚Äìfetal interface  
- **Zheng68k** (Nature Communications, 2017): PBMC profiling with 10x Genomics

These datasets have been preprocessed and harmonized to support evaluation in **long-tailed** and **class-incremental** annotation tasks, as used in our **scLTCIA** framework.
